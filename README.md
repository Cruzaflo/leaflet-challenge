# leaflet-challenge

This project maps earthquake data from the past 7 days. 
The data is in geoJSON format and provided from the following link: 
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

leaflet is used in Javascript to generate the map. The map uses circles as points to plot the coordinates of the earthquakes.
